This is a screen for the c64. While the code is a bit brutal, it does the job alright. It targets the acme cross compiler, and no other tools were used for making it, so it's all written manually :)

If you're running it on vice, just drag and drop the .pgn directly from the /bin directory on it and it'll load automatically.

Enjoy!
