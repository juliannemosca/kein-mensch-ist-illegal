# kein-mensch-ist-illegal

This is a screen for the c64. While the code is a bit brutal, it does the job alright. It targets the acme cross compiler, and no other tools were used for making it, so it's all written manually :)

If you're running it on vice just drag and drop the .pgn on it and it'll load automatically.

Enjoy!
